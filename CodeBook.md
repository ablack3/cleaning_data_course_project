# Codebook for the UCI_HAR_tidy.txt dataset

## Brief high level description of the data
This data is a subset of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original data can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones .

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

I don’t have the expertise to adequately explain these variables but I will do my best. The subject_ID is the id of the subject performing the activity. The measurements are taken from the cell phone’s gyroscope and accelerometer. The prefix t denotes time domain measurements while the prefix f denoted frequency domain measurements. The suffixs X, Y,Z refer to measurements on the X, Y and Z axes. I believe that the term body refers to measurements that have had gravitational force removed. All of the measurements have been normalized to the interval [0,1].


### Identifying Variables
"subject_ID" - ID for the subject performing the activity
"activity" - Activity of daily living that was performed
	"LAYING" 
        "SITTING" 
        "STANDING"     
        "WALKING"        
        "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS" 
	"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
